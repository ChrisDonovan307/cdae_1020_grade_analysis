#' Table of Contents for CDAE 1020 Grade Analysis

#' This is used for navigating scripts in the project. The intro section gives
#' a crash course R basics and then an example of how to analyze grades using
#' anonymized data. 

#' The analyze_grades section introduces a function to make grade analysis much
#' faster. Keep in mind that using it won't help you learn R, though! It is best
#' to learn to do things manually first.

#' Note that it is important that you access the project by first opening the 
#' cdae1020_grade_analysis.Rproj file. This will open the project and should
#' automatically open the navigation script. If the navigation script does not 
#' come up automatically, find it in the files section in the bottom 
#' right of RStudio. If you are reading this without having opened the .Rproj
#' file, close RStudio and open the .Rproj first!

#' A few useful commands for navigating the project:
#'   Use [ALT + o] to close all folds (sections)
#'   Use [ALT + Shift + o] to open all folds
#'   Use [F2] or [CTRL/CMD + Left Click] on a file path to open that script.
